## Overview of an example workflow: Fastq data quality checking

This is an example workflow to check the quality of the paired-end fastq files using `FastQC` software.

## Installation

- __Running environment__: 
    - The workflow was constructed based on the __Linux system__.

- __Required software and versions__: 
    - [FastQC v0.11.9](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/download.html#fastqc)
    - [multiqc](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC)
    - [R 3.6.3](https://cran.r-project.org/) for results ploting
        - [RStudio 1.4](https://rstudio.com/), [ggplot2 3.3.3](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html), [tidyr 1.1.2](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr)


## Input Data

The example data used here is the paired-end fastq file generated by using Illumina platform.  

- R1 FASTQ file: `input/reads1.fastq`  
- R2 FASTQ file: `input/reads2.fastq`  

Each entry in a FASTQ files consists of 4 lines:  

1. A sequence identifier with information about the sequencing run and the cluster. The exact contents of this line vary by based on the BCL to FASTQ conversion software used.  
2. The sequence (the base calls; A, C, T, G and N).  
3. A separator, which is simply a plus (+) sign.  
4. The base call quality scores. These are Phred +33 encoded, using ASCII characters to represent the numerical quality scores.  

The first entry of the input data:
```

```


## Major steps

#### Step 1: running the FastQC to conduct quality checking
- Note that you have to normalize the path in the shell script.

```
sh workflow/1_run_fastqc.sh
```

#### Step 2: aggregate results from FastQC

```
sh workflow/2_aggregate_results.sh
```

#### Step 3: view the results

- Results can be visualized by clicking `output/multiqc_report.html`.
- Alternatively, you can plot the results yourself using the below R code.

```
3_visualize_results.Rmd
```
